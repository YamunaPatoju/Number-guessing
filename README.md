NUMBER GUESSING GAME

HOW IT WORKS:
1.The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2.The user is asked to guess the number and provides input.
3.If the guess is too low or too high, the program gives a hint.
4.The game continues until the correct number is guessed, and the number of attempts is displayed.

FEATURES:
-Random Number Generation: The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
-Hints: If your guess is too low or too high, the program gives feedback.
Attempt Tracker: The game tracks the number of attempts it takes to guess the correct number.
